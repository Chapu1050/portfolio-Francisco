**Frontend reflection and Study**

I had to adapt a lot of the design as it was designed from a mobile point of view and not a desktop point of view. I decided to keep the map as the main starting point but with the extra screen space I was able to add a navbar and a sideBar. The Navbar has the intention to be used with more profile related things while the sidebar will be used with more functionality based things.

Instead of a traditional feed, since my app is more location focused I opted for a map. Here Posts are placed according to their longitude and latitude vs the generally linear timeline that other social media apps have. This is to give a feeling of the app being more dynamic. 

Some features I could not get to finishing were routes and friending. I wanted to make it so that friends can send each other gifts which are postcards. These postcards would get developed by joining observations and their images together and could be used as a neat tool to show off. Postcards received would be able to be used in a scrapbook which I also could not get around to completing.

A very useful tool for the design was figma and the color palette generator. These helped me achieve satisfying aesthetics that I would enjoy.
