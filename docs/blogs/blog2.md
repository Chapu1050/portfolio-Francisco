# Interview for Nature Related App

## Interview Report:

### Hunch: 

Many people tend to post nature related pictures in their social media posts, be it stories or permanent posts. This leads me to believe that there is an audience for nature related pictures on these sites so I would like to explore the use case of a social media app dedicated to nature photos including animals and plants and their locations. 


### Rosa Interview Summary:

For the interview I decided to explore aspects of Rosa’s unintentional nature walks. She told me she does not take many intentionally but I tried to dig in deeper into what she does on these unintentional walks. She seemed mostly uninterested until we talked about her walks back where she used to live in Miami. 

When talking about her walks in Miami, she told me that she takes plenty of pictures when she sees pretty flowers. She proceeded to show me many pictures she has taken of plants, flowers and animals in Miami, including mango trees,  geckos and iguanas. I asked her why she does not have many pictures of plants, flowers or animals in Boston and she in response said that “Boston feels like a soulless concrete jungle”. She said that if she knew about the nature that was more readily accessible, that might change. 

It seems like there was some initial tension due to her disappointment in Boston’s nature, especially when compared to Miami. Once we started talking about Miami, I was able to see how her interest shifted and she was much more engaged. It seems like interest in this app could be tightly linked to location and accessibility to nature. Perhaps features that make nature more apparent in day to day life could attract more interest. She said that she found some potential places to go to from social media, namely a corn maze and an apple patch. 

### Annie Interview Summary:

For this interview I decided to explore aspects of Annie’s animal lover side. She was relatively uninterested when talking about nature walks, however she had a much stronger interest when talking about animal related content she follows on Instagram. 

When talking about nature walks she said she had a general disinterest in them, citing her walks she would take every day to school in Maryland. She would have to walk near the woods for around 30 minutes everyday to school and it felt more like a chore than an actual enjoyable part of her routine. 

She showed more interest once we started talking about the animal side of things. She showed me a whole album she has of animals she has seen on campus which she routinely sends to her friends. These include squirrels, rabbits and birds. She then talked about animal photography accounts she follows. She mentioned harvest mice and other rodent photographers. One animal in particular that she is very interested in is the hyrax, a small cliff dwelling mammal. She follows a lot of content creators that post about hyraxes and cited them as a reason for her hour out trip to the zoo to finally see the creature in person. 

It seems like initially there was some disinterest due to Annie’s overexposure to flora in Maryland, where she would walk every day to school; however when we talked about animals there was a much stronger interest. She cited social media as the main reason she went to see a specific animal at a zoo which was an hour away. She also routinely shares animal pictures and it seems like features that locate where specific animals are can garner more interest from people such as Annie. 

## Design Opportunities:

1. From Rosa’s interview, it seems like people are not entirely aware of the nature that surrounds them in certain places such as the urban areas of Boston. It could be interesting to explore methods that make these places more noticeable such as maps integrated into the app for this purpose.
2. Rosa said that she would like to know of the plants in her area and what animals inhabit them, perhaps the map can include the location of specific objects, such as flowers and last sightings of certain animals and information about those objects. These could be crowdsourced from users of the app. In the case of plants, flowers and trees these could be listed as permanent locations along with popular nature walking routes and lakes. 
3. Annie traveled for over an hour to see one specific Animal. Being able to sort and find specific plants or animals that are closest to the user can encourage users to look for specific plants or animals in their immediate environment or also encourage them to take a trip. 
4. Assuming there is some sort of feed feature, we can allow users to sort by plants or animals in order to consume media related to that plant or animal specifically. This will allowusers such as  Annie to search and consume harvest mice and hyrax content.

## Planning Materials: ##


### **Guiding Questions:**

1. **How often do you go on walks in nature?**
   - 1.1. How often do you post about things you find on these walks?
   - 1.2. Have you found new places to walk or explore through social media?

2. **How far have you traveled to visit such a place?**
   - 2.1. Was it worth it?

3. **Do you follow anyone who posts pictures related to nature walks, landscapes, or specific animals on social media?**
   - 3.1. Have you discovered something new from these posts?
   - 3.2. Do you plan to explore and find out about these things on your own?

4. **Have you learned about any routes or fun nature facts that resonate with you through social media?**


### Interview Participants: 

I have chosen two interviewees: Rosa, a middle school math teacher in Massachusetts who’s social media presence lies mostly in the micro-blogging site Tumblr. She frequently blogs and catches up on blogs of other mutuals and friends and Annie, my partner here at MIT. She is a design major Senior. She uses Instagram, as her main social media where she catches up on reels, memes and animal facts but posts very infrequently. She used to be more active on Tik Tok where she posted more frequently and engaged a wider audience, however this is no longer the case. I chose them as my main social media use relies on just consumption of my Instagram feed however Annie and Rosa have plenty of experience with interacting with wider audiences in their past social media use. 


### Rosa interview Raw Notes: 
doesn't go on an intentional nature walks
but when she does she takes pictures of flowers and plants she finds interesting. Would take more pictures of animals if she knew what they were and what to look out for. Same with plants. Would love to learn more about the nature of the area she moved to. She feels like Boston is lifeless compared to where she used to live and she would love to learn more to know that is not the case. In Miami she lives in a very green place where nature is immediately accessible. *Shows me view of her window including geckos and iguanas and backyard mango trees*
Would you go visit plants and trees if you knew where they were? 
-Yes!!! and what animals like these plants.
Figuring out native fruits. - Doesn't use "in person social media" so finding IRL locations does not really happen in these
What about friends?
Yes-apple picking and corn mazes that she intends to go to on the fall months


### Annie Interview Raw Notes:
Takes pictures of animals and plants (photographs every animal she sees) Camera roll full of bunnies .
Went on a trip to China and saw a very large pretty lake and other landmarks on social media.
Follows photographers of Harvest mice that have tea and things and flowers. Rodent based nature accounts Costa Rica Nature conservationist. Follows many accounts dedicated to Hyraxes.
Has gone out of her way to travel for an hour to see Hyraxes at a zoo and also lists Costa Rica as one of her dream locations. Hopes to see animals she finds on social media in IRL.
